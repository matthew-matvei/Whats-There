    "instructions": "PreparationFor spice rub:                                        Combine all ingredients in small bowl.                                                                            Do ahead: Can be made 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.                                    For chimichurri sauce:                                        Combine first 8 ingredients in blender; blend until almost smooth. Add 1/4 of parsley, 1/4 of cilantro, and 1/4 of mint; blend until incorporated. Add remaining herbs in 3 more additions, pureeing until almost smooth after each addition.                                                                            Do ahead: Can be made 3 hours ahead. Cover; chill.                                    For beef tenderloin:                                        Let beef stand at room temperature 1 hour.                                                                            Prepare barbecue (high heat). Pat beef dry with paper towels; brush with oil. Sprinkle all over with spice rub, using all of mixture (coating will be thick). Place beef on grill; sear 2 minutes on each side. Reduce heat to medium-high. Grill uncovered until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of beef registers 130F for medium-rare, moving beef to cooler part of grill as needed to prevent burning, and turning occasionally, about 40 minutes. Transfer to platter; cover loosely with foil and let rest 15 minutes. Thinly slice beef crosswise. Serve with chimichurri sauce.                                                                            *Available at specialty foods stores and from tienda.com."
