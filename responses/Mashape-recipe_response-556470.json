    "instructions": "Beat the egg in a bowl, add a pinch of salt and the flour and pour in the extra virgin olive oil and the beer: if needed, add a tablespoon of water to make a smooth but not too liquid batter. It is supposed to cover the apples, not to slide off!Peel the apples, core them paying attention not to break them and cut the apples into horizontal slices, 1 cm thick.Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. The right moment to fry the apples is when the oil starts to smoke, as grandma says. Dip the apple slices into the batter and deep fry them until cooked through and golden on both sides.Transfer the apples into a plate lined with a paper towel. Sprinkle the fritters with icing sugar and serve them warm."
